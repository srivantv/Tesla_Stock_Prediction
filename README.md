Developed a Tesla stock price prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.
Gathered historical stock data from the Yahoo Finance API to train the model. The LSTM-based model,
implemented using libraries like TensorFlow, will forecast Tesla stock prices, aiding investors and traders in
decision-making.
